                    The International Conference on Intelligent Computational and Communication Technologies for
                    Sustainable Development (ICCT-SD 2026) focuses on integrating intelligent computational methods and
                    advanced communication technologies to address global sustainability challenges. It provides a
                    platform for researchers, academicians, industry professionals, and policymakers to exchange
                    knowledge and present innovations that support the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The
                    scope covers Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart
                    Systems, Big Data Analytics and Cloud Computing, Next-Generation Networks, Security and Privacy, and
                    other emerging technologies. Emphasis is placed on sustainable solutions for sectors such as
                    healthcare, agriculture, urban development, manufacturing, and climate resilience. The conference
                    aims to foster collaboration, promote technological innovation, and translate research into
                    practical applications, contributing to a more sustainable and equitable future through
                    interdisciplinary engagement and knowledge dissemination.
